                  <h2>About The Workshop</h2>
                  <p>Battery energy storage systems are rising as the backbone of numerous industrial and civilian systems, playing a key role in moving the world into a clean energy era. 
                    Their performance and safety critically rely on advanced battery management systems, which have attracted considerable research, particularly from the systems and control community, in the past decade. 
                    The growing efforts have led to tremendous progresses in leveraging control theory to enable complex, high-performing battery systems in a broad range of application domains. 
                    The developments in turn continuously stimulate exciting insights into emerging challenges. 
                    This pre-conference workshop will gather veteran researchers in this vibrant field to share up-to-date advances and perspectives about future innovations. 
                    It also aims to foster a creative space for open discussions among participants, which will spark innovative ideas and inspirations about future control-theory-driven battery management. The talks will cover various key dimensions of this field, highlighting a confluence of electrochemical modeling, control theory, machine learning and industrial applications. 
                    We welcome researchers, graduate students and professional engineers to join the workshop and gain an exciting exposure to the cutting-edge developments, new trends and open challenges in the field of battery management.</p>

                            <p>This two-part talk will examine two problems in the battery management systems domain. 
                              The first problem is the optimization of battery test trajectories for parameter identifiability. 
                              There is an extensive existing literature showing that electrochemical batteries suffer from poor identifiability, and proposing different trajectory optimization algorithms for improving identifiability. 
                              The ideas in this literature have been validated experimentally for multiple battery chemistries, including both the lithium-ion and lithium-sulfur chemistries. 
                              This talk pushes this topic further by examining an interesting dilemma: when battery parameter identifiability is poor, it is difficult to quantify, and therefore difficult to optimize, especially for machine learning-based battery models. 
                              The talk will examine a new approach for addressing this challenge. The second problem is ensuring battery safety, especially in the context of cascading thermal runaway events. Control barrier function theory provides a rigorous foundation that can be used for battery temperature control, with the goal of preventing thermal runaway. However, once thermal runaway ensues in a given battery cell, the substantial resulting heat generation makes it futile to attempt to stop it in that specific cell. This creates a need for battery pack safety control algorithms that gracefully degrade from focusing on thermal runaway prevention to focusing on stopping thermal runaway propagation once it ensues. The talk will examine a novel mathematical approach for achieving such graceful degradation in the context of barrier function-based battery thermal safety control.</p>

                            <p>Estimation of battery parameters are important for ensuring the fidelity of battery models and the efficacy of model-based battery management. Estimation typically involves 3 basic elements, i.e. model, algorithm, and data (e.g. current, voltage, and temperature measurements). We have been interested in exploring how the structure of measurement data affects the accuracy of estimation. In a series of works, we first derive the general form for the estimation error under the common least squares formulation, which reveals fundamentally how errors are induced by system uncertainties, including parameter mismatch, random measurement noises, and unmodeled dynamics. The results give insights and interpretation on the criteria for evaluating the quality of data, including the popular Fisher information, and also inspire new ones that relate to the propagation of uncertainties. We then proceed to explore the optimization of data to improve the accuracy of estimation, including design of input excitation to generate data when there is input control authority, and selection of data from existing database or stream when lack thereof. The efforts lead to the discovery of unique optimal current excitation patterns for estimating different battery electrochemical parameters. It is also found that the input optimization problem suffers from an intrinsic challenge caused by parameter uncertainty. Different approaches have been pursued to address the issue, including reinforcement learning, and a recently proposed nondimensionalization-based reformulation technique.</p>

                            <p>An accurate estimation of the state of health (SOH) of batteries is critical to ensuring the safe and reliable operation of electric vehicles (EVs). Feature-based machine learning methods have exhibited enormous potential for monitoring battery health status rapidly and precisely. However, the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality real-vehicle data hinders the development of the battery management system (BMS). Those real-world operational conditions may generate some extrapolation of battery characteristics obtained from lab testing, thereby generating significant errors in real-world BMS algorithms. We first summarized and analyzed various individual health indicators with mechanism-related interpretations, which provide insightful guidance on how these features relate to battery degradation modes. Moreover, we analyzed the operational data of 300 EVs over three years to understand the disparities between real-vehicle data and laboratory battery test data and their effect on SOH estimation. In addition, the trade-off between the performance and practicality of fusion strategies could be well balanced by tracking the latest driving behavior statistics. Lastly, we proposed a multi-modal deep learning framework to accurately predict the SOH of batteries in EVs by leveraging real-world data.</p>

                            <p>The soon-to-be-regulated indicators of battery state of health (SOH) based on capacity fade and resistance increase are insufficient for predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in second-life applications<sup>1</sup>. The electrochemical community blames the path dependency of the battery degradation mechanisms for our inability to forecast the degradation. The control community knows that the path dependency is addressed by full state estimation. To this end, we define the deepSOH states that capture the individual contributions of all the common degradation mechanisms, namely, SEI, plating, and mechanical fracture, to the loss of lithium inventory<sup>2</sup>.
                              We show that even the electrode-specific SOH (eSOH), we defined in 2019<sup>3</sup> is not enough to fully define the degradation states. We demonstrate this shortcoming by simulating infinite possible degradation trajectories and remaining useful lives (RUL) from a unique eSOH using a recently developed parameterizable and predictive models physics-based model of battery lifetime<sup>4</sup>.
                              We then show preliminary results of deepSOH estimation and RUL prediction with explainable and actionable information on the origins of degradation for broad new use patterns.<br>

                            <p>This talk discusses modeling and estimation algorithms for lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery cells. Li-S batteries are appealing due to their high gravimetric energy density (2600 Wh/kg theoretical density vs. 250-300 Wh/kg for traditional lithium-ion cells), usage of cheap and abundant materials, and lower toxicity. Meanwhile, they suffer from low cycle life due to a so-called “shuttle effect”, electrode volume expansion, electrolyte degradation, and more. Li-S cells, moreso than lithium-ion, require active battery management systems to monitor these mechanisms. However, research on Li-S modeling and algorithms are relatively nascent. This talk discusses mathematical models for Li-S batteries, highlighting specific challenges in state estimation, parameter estimation, and more. You will find that the specific challenges are both unique and interesting relative to corresponding research on traditional lithium-ion cells.</p>

                            <p>Professor Gregory Offer will present the research his group have done over the past ten years in understanding lithium-ion battery degradation, how to model it, and how close those models are getting to usefully predict lifetime. The journey began with pioneering work demonstrating how different thermal management approaches strongly affected the degradation rates of lithium-ion pouch cells. At around the same time the group began working on understanding and modelling the physical mechanisms of degradation.<br>
                              The group have demonstrated how understanding non-uniform temperature and heat generation is essential in cell design. This gives rise to non-uniform degradation which is critical to understanding and explaining multiple experimentally observed phenomenon. If this strong positive coupling between the thermal and electrochemical behavior is not properly considered, then any model of a battery risks being very wrong except under the most benign conditions. Over the same period, the group have published multiple ground-breaking papers on understanding and modelling multiple coupled degradation mechanisms. The group’s work also includes advancing our understanding of lithium plating, positive electrode (cathode) decomposition, unequal degradation in silicon carbon composite electrodes, particle cracking, electrolyte consumption and cell dry-out, and how multiple degradation mechanisms are coupled with each other and trigger accelerated degradation (the knee point/cliff-edge/etc).</p>

                            <p>The battery industry has been in the midst of unprecedented growth and change. As battery technology scales and grows, small problems have become major challenges for the industry and threaten the safe and economical transition to an electrified economy. As veterans in the battery industry we have seen the difficulties that come with large scale battery production and have been searching for a solution. Our best answer is CT (computed tomography) x-ray scanning. This technology has been widely used in the medical field, and offers the ability to visualize and characterize the internal structure of the battery at high resolution. Mechanical structure, defects, and stresses are visible and a large number of the problems we have encountered can be found and diagnosed with this technique. We will discuss the value of CT imaging in factory ramp-up and production, and how we can make this data available by taking scanning time from hours to minutes and eventually seconds.</p>
                            <p><strong>Biography:</strong> After growing up testing nuclear reactors in the desert, Patrick went to college at Caltech where he studied physics in an attempt to understand how everything worked. This was partially successful, so he decided to figure out how deep the rabbit hole was and went to Harvard to study quantum computing, because everything else was too easy. Along the way he got sidetracked and ended up doing a lot of materials science at MIT, but he eventually found the exit and left with a PhD. His materials science work convinced him that batteries were one of the most important technologies for society and he started working at an electric aircraft company, designing and building more powerful batteries for aviation. This was when he got really interested in understanding why batteries failed and how to predict those failures. Around this time he and Peter met and collaborated on a couple of papers using machine learning to predict battery lifetime. In the process, he transitioned to Toyota Research Institute as a research scientist, and lead development on a materials informatics platform to generate and analyze large amounts of battery data. After completing this project, he left TRI to run a battery modeling group at Zitara. And during one of his trips to San Francisco, he met up with Peter and Eric and started talking about the idea that would become Glimpse.</p>

                            <p>Recent research advancements on battery management systems have achieved significant success in addressing issues ranging from state monitoring to optimal charging. Despite these strides, lithium-ion batteries present higher levels of complexity in dynamics in some emerging applications, such as electric aircraft, introducing thorny problems that state-of-the-art methods struggle to address. As a specific example, electric aircraft necessitate the discharge of lithium-ion batteries at high C-rates, which complicates the development of accurate dynamic models, hampers predictions of remaining energy, and makes model parameter identification difficult. Our latest research indicates that machine learning could provide valuable solutions to these issues, leveraging its strengths in data analysis and understanding. In this presentation, we will share key findings and results from our studies and explore the future prospects of machine learning-driven battery management systems.</p>
